# Deploying a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Demonstration Environment

This deployment scenario installs the major [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] components on a single computer, complete with a base application and database with demonstration data. After the installation, you will have an end-to-end environment, where you can access [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] data from the Web client. The installation requires minimal hardware resources, preparation, and configuration.  

## Installed Components and Configuration  

### Components  
 This scenario installs the following components:  

-   [!INCLUDE[webservercomponents](../developer/includes/webservercomponents.md)]  

-   Internet Information Services

    If IIS is already installed, then the setup will enable any required features that are not currently enabled.

-    [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)]  

-   SQL Server Database Components, including [!INCLUDE[demolong](../developer/includes/demolong_md.md)] and demo license.

    For information about what you can do with this license, see [Demonstration License for Business Central On-Premises](../developer/properties/devenv-demolicense-properties.md).  

-    [!INCLUDE[admintool](../developer/includes/admintool.md)] 

-    Al Development Environment

-   [!INCLUDE[webserver](../developer/includes/webservercomponents.md)]
 
    - Port: 8080 (inbound rule automatically added to Windows Firewall)
    - Protocol: HTTP

-   Windows authentication for authenticating users.  

-   [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] configuration:  

    -   Service instance: [!INCLUDE[serverinstance](../developer/includes/serverinstance.md)]  

    -   Client service port: 7046  

    -   SOAP web services port: 7047  

    -   OData web services port: 7048  

-   [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] database components configuration:  

    -   Service instance: BCDEMO  

    -   Database: Demo Database BC (18-0)  

-   NETWORK SERVICE account is used as the service account for [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)] and database.  

## Prepare for the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] installation  

1.  Get access to the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] installation media. For example, this could be a DVD or network drive that contains the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] installation files.  

2.  Make sure that the computer meets the hardware and software requirements.  

    For more information, see [System Requirements](system-requirement-business-central.md).  


## Run [!INCLUDE[prodsetup](../developer/includes/prodsetup.md)]  

1.  From the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] installation media, run the setup.exe file to start the [!INCLUDE[prodsetup](../developer/includes/prodsetup.md)].  

2. Follow the setup until you get to the **[!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]** page, then choose **Advanced installation option** > **Install Demo**.  

    The installation starts. This can take several minutes.  

## Open the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)]  

-   To open the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] from the computer where you installed [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], on the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs**, and then choose **[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] Web Client**.  

-   To open the [!INCLUDE[nav_web](../developer/includes/nav_web_md.md)] from other devices on the network, open an Internet browser, and type the following URL in the address box:

    ```
    https://ComputerName:8080/BC180  
    ```
    Substitute **ComputerName** with the name of the computer where you installed [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]. If you are working on the computer where you installed [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], then you can use **localhost**.  

    For example:

    ```
    https://localhost:8080/BC180
    ```
